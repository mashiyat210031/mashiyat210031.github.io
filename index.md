Hi! I'm Mashiyat — a digital strategist who thrives on the intersection of SEO, analytics, and content-driven marketing. With hands-on experience across tools like SEMrush, Tableau, and Google Analytics, I enjoy uncovering insights that drive real business results. I'm especially passionate about using data storytelling to improve user experiences, optimize content, and build strategies that scale.

Below are two featured mock projects where I applied my skills in digital marketing and analytics. Each one reflects the kind of work I love doing: turning raw data into actionable insights.

## Professional Journey

From campaign planning to analytics, I’ve worked across multiple areas of digital marketing, including content strategy, SEO audits, and loyalty program optimization. I enjoy diving deep into marketing data, identifying what’s working (and what’s not), and translating that into action plans that make sense for both teams and customers.

My goal is to keep growing as a strategist and analyst — combining creativity with data to help brands make smarter marketing decisions.
