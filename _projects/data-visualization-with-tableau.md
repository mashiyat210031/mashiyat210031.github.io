This project features an interactive Tableau dashboard built using a public online retail dataset. It simulates a business scenario where an e-commerce company needs to uncover trends in sales, customer behavior, and product performance to drive strategic decisions.

### Summary  
The dashboard combines multiple perspectivesâ€”from temporal trends to purchasing patternsâ€”to help answer business-critical questions. Itâ€™s designed to reveal not just *what* is happening, but *why*, by connecting high-level metrics with granular behavior.

---

### Key Insights  
- Sales volume builds gradually and peaks sharply near the end of the year, indicating seasonal demand spikes.  
- A small subset of products contributes disproportionately to total revenue, revealing opportunities for inventory prioritization.  
- Certain customer segments consistently spend more per transaction, suggesting a target group for loyalty or premium product marketing.  
- A correlation between average basket size and total contribution highlights potential to grow revenue by encouraging larger orders from lower-contributing segments.

### Dashboard Analysis  

The dashboard is structured for layered analysis, moving from general performance to specific, actionable segments.

- **Temporal trends** highlight predictable seasonality, allowing for better forecasting and promotional timing.  
- **Product-level performance** uncovers overperformers and underperformers, suggesting where to focus stock, bundling, or promotional strategies.  
- **Customer segmentation** based on basket size and purchase frequency identifies high-LTV groups worth retaining or upselling.  
- **Purchase behavior patterns** suggest gaps between product popularity and profitability, guiding merchandising strategy.  

The integrated design reveals how individual behaviors scale up to affect overall performance.

### Analysis of Individual Charts  

- **Sales Performance (Line Chart):**  
  Sales ramp up toward year-end, pointing to seasonal purchase cycles. This suggests timing product launches or discounts around these peaks could maximize ROI.

- **Top 10 Products (Bar Chart):**  
  A few products dominate revenue, revealing an 80/20 dynamic. These should be prioritized for inventory restocking and featured in marketing efforts.

- **Top 10 Purchases (Bubble Chart):**  
  High-frequency items may not always be the top revenue drivers. This distinction suggests potential in bundling high-volume, low-revenue items with premium products to improve margins.

- **Top 10 Buyers (Treemap):**  
  Some buyers show much larger average basket sizes than others, indicating a potential niche of bulk or loyal buyers who may respond to exclusive offers or early-access deals.

- **Sales by Country (Map):**  
  Regions with lower sales but high basket size hint at untapped demand. Marketing or fulfillment investments in these areas could yield strong ROI.

- **Share of Sales (Scatter Plot):**  
  Some customers contribute significantly with relatively few transactions, showing the value of nurturing high-spend, low-frequency segmentsâ€”possibly with re-engagement campaigns.

### Conclusion  
This dashboard goes beyond surface metrics to expose behavioral and seasonal patterns that can inform pricing, promotion, and customer retention strategies. By identifying who buys, what they buy, and when they buy, it empowers decision-makers to act with precision and insight.
