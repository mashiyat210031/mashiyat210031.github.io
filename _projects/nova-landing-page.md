## 🧪 Project Overview

The **Nova Landing Page** is a fictional project created as a design and development exercise to simulate the front-end needs of a modern tech startup. The concept behind *NovaTech* is to present a clean, simple, and professional digital presence for a company focused on next-generation technology and innovation.

The project is entirely hand-coded using **HTML5** and **CSS3**, with an emphasis on responsive layout, modern visual design, and semantic structure. It was built to showcase a typical landing page experience — including a value proposition, feature overview, company bio, and contact details — all within a single-scroll, user-friendly layout.

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary goals of the project included:

- **Build a responsive layout** that adjusts cleanly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
- **Practice semantic HTML5** for better accessibility, SEO, and long-term maintainability.
- **Use only vanilla CSS**, avoiding frameworks like Bootstrap, to improve CSS skills and understanding of layout mechanics.
- **Simulate a real-world project**, including brand naming, content planning, and UI/UX design considerations.
- **Focus on clarity and usability**, with intuitive navigation and easily digestible sections.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structured the page content using semantic tags like `<section>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>`.
- **CSS3**: Used for all visual styling — including layout spacing, typography, hover states, color schemes, and responsiveness.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and project hosting via GitHub Pages.

## 🎨 Design Approach

The visual design is intentionally minimal, with soft color contrasts, ample whitespace, and centered content containers. Each section is enclosed in a bordered and padded box to guide the user's eye down the page, making the information easier to scan and consume.

Typography choices focus on legibility, using system fonts to ensure fast loading and consistent rendering across platforms. The hero section uses a prominent heading and a contrasting call-to-action button for immediate engagement.

The navigation is straightforward, anchored with internal links (`#features`, `#about`, `#contact`) to allow for seamless single-page interaction. Hover effects add a touch of interactivity while keeping the user experience smooth and distraction-free.
