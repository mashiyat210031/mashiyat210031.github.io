## Project Overview

This project includes a mock audit of a recipe blog using SEMrush to evaluate its technical health, keyword landscape, backlink profile, and content opportunities. The purpose was to simulate a real-world SEO consultation and uncover actionable insights.

## Key Insights

### 1. **Domain Authority & Traffic Trends**

- **Authority Score**: 76 – This reflects a strong domain reputation built through consistent performance, content quality, and backlinks. For a content-driven site like a recipe blog, this is a solid foundation.
- **Monthly Traffic**: 7.9 million (mostly organic) – Organic channels are the main traffic driver, which highlights the effectiveness of their SEO strategy. The relatively small share of paid search suggests room to experiment with PPC for visibility spikes.
- **Backlinks**: 3.2 million from 127K referring domains – This shows excellent authority and content syndication across the web. However, a 7% drop in backlinks implies the site might be losing link equity—potentially due to broken pages or outdated content.

**Recommendation**: Implement a regular backlink health check and consider reclaiming lost high-value links, especially on top-performing content.

### 2. **Keyword Performance & Intent Alignment**

- The site ranks for over 2.2 million organic keywords. Informational intent dominates, which aligns perfectly with recipe and how-to content.
- Keywords like “starbucks sizes” and “taste of home recipes” rank in Position 1 and draw in significant search volume. This indicates strong topical authority and content alignment.
- However, transactional and commercial intent keywords are under-leveraged.

**Recommendation**: Integrate content that bridges informational and transactional intent—like “best kitchen gadgets for home cooks” or “budget-friendly meal prep kits”—to capture lower-funnel traffic and support monetization.

### 3. **Traffic Journey Analysis**

- **Direct Traffic Growth**: +45% – Suggests high brand recognition and returning visitors.
- **Organic Search Decline**: -21% from Google – Could be seasonal, algorithmic, or a symptom of keyword cannibalization or aging content.
- **Pinterest & Discover Traffic Up**: Indicates strong visual appeal and good optimization for Google Discover.

**Recommendation**: Revise underperforming evergreen content and optimize for Google Discover through engaging imagery, structured data, and mobile readability.

### 4. **Content Optimization Audit**

- Pages such as those ranking for “chicken noodle soup recipe” and “aperol spritz” are slightly under-optimized in terms of schema usage, video inclusion, and referring domains.
- Readability scores are decent but still fall short compared to competitors.
- Markup is inconsistently implemented (e.g., missing “Article” schema).

**Recommendation**: Standardize schema implementation and embed short-form video content where possible. For recipe posts, structured data and video dramatically increase eligibility for SERP features.

### 5. **Site Health & Technical Performance**

- **Overall Site Health**: 72% (benchmark: 92%) – Many pages have crawl or load speed issues.
- **Core Web Vitals**: Not implemented – A crucial missed opportunity.
- **Errors**: Include broken links, slow HTML load, and invalid structured data.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize Core Web Vitals optimization. Address slow-loading pages and broken links. Fix structured data errors to improve rich result eligibility.

### 6. **Content Opportunities**

- High engagement on articles like “85 Best Easy Christmas Desserts” and “Easy Christmas Cookies for Once-a-Year Bakers” shows what kind of holiday content resonates.
- Keywords like “easy healthy dinner recipes for picky eaters” have low competition and modest volume—perfect for targeting underserved niches.

**Recommendation**: Build a seasonal content calendar informed by historical engagement trends. Lean into specific personas (e.g., picky eaters, budget-conscious cooks) to capture niche traffic.

## Final Thoughts

The mock audit demonstrates that this recipe blog has built a solid SEO foundation, particularly in organic reach and content authority. However, technical improvements, schema enhancements, and broader keyword intent coverage could unlock further growth. The qualitative insights gathered here offer a clear path to optimization without over-reliance on paid strategies.
